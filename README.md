Working of loading page: We have use GIF for making Loading page, we have used time module for stopping for 5 sec at the loading page. We also use sleep function which uses the parameter of how many seconds you want to sleep for stopping. After this we terminate this function at a dashboard of login page.
Then we will be given three options of Admin page, Registered student, New admission.
a.	Admin Panel:  In this panel first the person will enter the credentials to enter the panel. Then he/she will see a Admin dashboard. Then he/she can see the no. of students registered/applied/rejected/selected. 
b.	Registered Student: In this panel the registered student can enter the credential. He can check that whether he is selected or rejected. He can also browse the course details. 
c.	New admission: Whenever a new admission case is there we will ask to fill up the form, which will include name, father’s name, mother’s name, phone number, 12th result, College entrance test result, after that he will be asked to enter username and password which will be saved for future use and will help the student to login again.
